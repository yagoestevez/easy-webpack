# Easy Webpack

This is an basic and easy to use template/recipe made for Webpack.

If you want to have a **live server watching for your changes** working with a transpiler that **transforms your modern Javascript into legacy Javascript code** and a **CSS prefixer** so you don't need to code for each and every browser in the market, this template might be for you.

It's main purpose is to help beginners speed up their development workflow while learning HTML, CSS and Javascript without loosing their minds trying to set up Webpack. Even if Webpack nowadays is fairly easy to use for basic stuff, beginners get overwhelmed by this kind of tools quite often.

Want to try this template? Beginner or not, you're more than welcome.
<br />

##### BEFORE USING IT

Before you start using this template, you will need to have installed `Node.js` and `NPM`. You can [download both from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Of course, you will need a browser, a terminal/command line and a code editor.
<br/>

##### USAGE

To use this template, just make a new folder and `clone` this repo:

```
mkdir your-new-project
cd your-new-project
git clone https://github.com/yagoestevez/easy-webpack.git
```

After the repo has been cloned successfully, install the dependencies, like this:

```
npm install
```

Now you can start using it. Just type:

```
npm start
```

A server will start and a new browser window will open with boilerplate code. Just remove the boilerplate code and type your own; you will see the result of your code updated after every changes made. 

Now, start building your next big thing!

##### TODO

- Add Sass and Pug to the template.
- Optimize code for production.

##### CONTRIBUTING

If you feel like giving a hand to this project you can do so by implementing new stuff (nothing pro, remember it's Easy Webpack hehe...). You can also help by testing it and giving feedback so we all can figure out how to make it better.

###### Anyways, thank you for reading!
